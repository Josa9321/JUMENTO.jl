## Enhancing JuMP with AUGMECON and AUGMECON 2: A Multi-Objective Optimization Implementation


Special thanks to the following libraries that significantly enhanced our project:

 - vOptLib: This library provides multiobjective instances and, in this project, played a crucial role in testing the frontiers generated by AUGMECON. You can access the library at: https://voptsolver.github.io/vOptLib/.
 - PyAUGMECON: allowed us to compare instances early in the development process and served as a source of inspiration. You can find PyAUGMECON on GitHub: https://github.com/wouterbles/pyaugmecon.
